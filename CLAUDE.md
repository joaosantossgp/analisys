# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Hybrid Python project: a CLI scraper that extracts DFP/ITR financial reports from Brazil's CVM regulator and persists them to SQLite/PostgreSQL, plus a Streamlit analytics dashboard and a PyQt6 desktop app for 449+ public companies.

## Required Workflow

Before changing any versioned file:

1. At the start of every executable chat, inspect:
   - open tasks in your own `lane:*`
   - child tasks received from other lanes in your lane
   - child tasks your lane opened for other lanes
   - open PRs tied to those issues, especially deliveries waiting for consumption
2. Find or create an open `task issue` in GitHub.
3. Ensure the issue has `kind:task`, one `status:*`, one `priority:*`, one `area:*`, one `risk:*`, and one `lane:*` label.
4. Ensure the issue body declares `Owner atual`, `Lane oficial`, `Workspace da task`, `Write-set esperado`, and `Classificacao de risco`.
5. Update the issue when work starts and keep the checklist/evidence current.
6. Create or reuse a dedicated worktree at `.claude/worktrees/<lane>/<issue-number>-<slug>/`.
7. Keep the repo root stable on `master` and do not switch task branches in the main workspace.
8. Work in a branch named `task/<issue-number>-<slug>`.
9. Open a PR with `Closes #<issue-number>` in the body.
10. Finish the task with `scripts/pr_complete.ps1 -Pr <number>` or an equivalent flow that waits for checks, confirms merge, verifies the linked issue is closed, and confirms the remote branch is gone when applicable.
11. Update the issue and relevant docs before considering the task complete.
12. Commit validated checkpoints, push them promptly, and merge to `master` when the task is complete and checks are green unless the user explicitly says not to.

### Jules-only exception

- The only allowed `PR-first` exception is for pull requests published by Jules (Google Labs).
- For a Jules PR, create the task after the PR opens, set `Workspace da task` to `jules://github/pr/<pr-number>`, apply `automation:jules`, and update the PR body with `Closes #<issue>`.
- Until that retroactive task exists and is linked, the PR must remain blocked by governance checks.
- This exception does not apply to humans, Codex, Claude, or any other agent.

## Publish and Merge Policy

- Do not leave completed work only in the local worktree.
- Commit when you reach a coherent, validated checkpoint.
- Push when the checkpoint should be preserved remotely or reflected in the PR.
- Open or update a draft PR as soon as the branch is reviewable.
- When acceptance criteria are satisfied and relevant checks pass:
  - update the issue;
  - mark the PR ready if needed;
  - use `scripts/pr_complete.ps1` or an equivalent flow to wait through green checks and complete the merge into `master`.
- Prefer squash merge for short-lived Codex branches.
- After merge, confirm the linked task closes and the remote branch is removed when possible.
- Remove the linked task worktree after merge when it is no longer needed.

Do not use `docs/AGENTS.md` as a backlog. The official backlog lives in GitHub Issues.

## Lane and Worktree Rules

- Official lanes:
  - `lane:frontend`
  - `lane:backend`
  - `lane:ops-quality`
- Rule of thumb: `1 task = 1 owner = 1 branch = 1 worktree = 1 PR`
- Use the repo root only as the stable `master` worktree.
- If you need to inspect another task, open a second editor window on that
  task's worktree instead of switching branches in the root workspace.
- Sensitive files are governed by `.github/guardrails/path-policy.json`.
- Paths in `shared-governance`, `critical-bootstrap`, `critical-runtime`, and
  `critical-contract` require the lane and `risk:*` classification allowed by
  the path policy.

## Parallel Work Protocol

- Treat the `task issue` as the ownership boundary, not the agent identity.
- If another IA or human takes over the same task, update `Owner atual` in the
  issue before continuing work.
- Keep `Lane oficial` and `Workspace da task` current in the issue body.
- Respect the declared `Write-set esperado`. If another open task needs the same
  write-set, coordinate through the issues or reduce scope before editing.
- Record dependencies or write-set collisions in the task issue before moving
  forward.
- Risk classes:
  - `risk:safe`: isolated write-set
  - `risk:shared`: touches shared files; PR must open in draft
  - `risk:contract-sensitive`: touches public API/schema/docs; PR must open in
    draft and document compatibility
- Shared public interfaces remain `additive-only` by default during parallel
  work.
- Breaking contract changes require a dedicated `risk:contract-sensitive` task,
  explicit coordination in the issue/PR, and serialized merge timing.
- Do not touch files outside the current lane or the shared governance policy
  unless the task explicitly allows it and the guardrails pass.
- If your lane needs work from another lane, open a formal child task instead of
  handing off informally in chat.
- A child task must declare `Task mae`, `Lane solicitante`, and
  `Criterio de consumo`.
- The parent task must list its `Tasks filhas` and remain `status:blocked`
  while the downstream child task is open or under review.
- After the child task is merged but before the requester lane consumes the
  delivery, the parent task moves to `status:awaiting-consumption`.
- Only the requester lane may mark the delivery as consumed and unblock the
  parent task.

## Architecture

### Data Pipeline

CVM website → `src/scraper.py` (CVMScraper) → `src/standardizer.py` (AccountStandardizer) → `src/database.py` (CVMDatabase, SQLAlchemy) → SQLite or PostgreSQL → `dashboard/` (Streamlit) or `cvm_pyqt_app.py` (PyQt6)

**`src/` module roles:**
- `src/utils.py` — `normalize_account_name()` + `generate_line_id_base()` (used throughout)
- `src/dictionary.py` — builds canonical account dictionary from CVM raw data
- `src/db.py` — Streamlit-free `get_engine()` factory (2-tier: `DATABASE_URL` env → SQLite); safe to import from CLI scripts and PyQt6
- `src/query_layer.py` — `CVMQueryLayer` class: all SQL queries for fetching statements (DRE, BPA, BPP, DFC, DVA, DMPL) by company/year/period. **Important**: `get_statement()` applies `fillna("")` on `STANDARD_NAME` before `pivot_table` — pandas silently drops NaN index rows.
- `src/kpi_engine.py` — `compute_all_kpis()`, `compute_quarterly_kpis()`: 60+ financial indicators (ROE, ROA, margins, solvency, etc.). Outputs include `UNIDADE` column (`"%"` or `"x"`). Quarterly mode trims leading periods where LTM flow KPIs are not computable.
- `src/ticker_map.py` — B3 ticker ↔ CVM code mapping utilities
- `src/excel_exporter.py` — Excel report generation with QA logs and validations. KPI sheet has columns: INDICADOR, FÓRMULA, UNIDADE, [periods], Δ YoY, Tendência. Category headers use individual cell writes (no merge_range).
- `src/statement_summary.py` — condensed multi-block statement builder (DRE, BPA, BPP, DFC). Filters to subtotal/summary `CD_CONTA` codes and optionally expands direct children. Used for high-level views without loading full pivot tables.

### Database

- **Local**: `data/db/cvm_financials.db` (SQLite, WAL mode); `data/cache/base_health_snapshot.json` stores the last base-health check result (committed to git, updated by PyQt6 app)
- **Production**: PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL`
- Connection fallback order: `DATABASE_URL` → SQLite (in `src/db.py`)
- Write path lives in `src/database.py`; read/query path lives in `src/query_layer.py`
- Core table: `financial_reports` (UPPER_CASE columns); metadata tables: `companies`, `account_names` (snake_case)
- Key column: `LINE_ID_BASE` (never `LINE_ID`)

### Dashboard Modules

`dashboard/app.py` is the slim orchestrator. Current tab structure:

- `dashboard/tabs/visao_geral.py` — KPI summary blocks and quarterly/period views
- `dashboard/tabs/demonstracoes.py` — Financial statement pivot tables (BPA, BPP, DRE, DFC, DVA, DMPL)
- `dashboard/tabs/download.py` — Excel export with KPIs

`dashboard/components/search_bar.py` — `render_sidebar()`: company search + year selection widget

**Data flow in app.py:**
1. `render_sidebar()` → selected company + year range
2. `CVMQueryLayer` → fetch statements from DB (cached `@st.cache_data` TTL 600s)
3. `compute_all_kpis()` / `compute_quarterly_kpis()` → KPI DataFrames
4. Tab renderers consume the precomputed data

> The dashboard is **read-only** — data refresh is handled exclusively by `cvm_pyqt_app.py`. There is no update button in Streamlit.

### PyQt6 Desktop App (`cvm_pyqt_app.py`)

Operational updater GUI. Main moving parts:
- `IntelligentSelectorService` ranks and prioritizes refresh work
- `UpdateWorker` builds the company/year plan, runs `CVMScraper`, and syncs `company_refresh_status`
- The UI exposes company search, year selection, progress tracking, and base-health summaries

### Scraper Core (`src/scraper.py`)

`CVMScraper` is the ingestion entrypoint for both CLI and PyQt flows. Key design choices:
- Vectorized Pandas (Boolean masks, no row-by-row loops)
- `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent downloads (`max_workers=5` default)
- SQLite WAL + `synchronous=OFF` for bulk inserts
- retry + backoff around company-level DB write failures
- DFC YTD→standalone conversion (`convert_dfc_ytd_to_standalone`)
- BPA/BPP closing validation + QA logs per run

### Scripts

Active scripts in `scripts/`. Key ones:
- `scripts/restaurar_historico.py` — restore historical data
- `scripts/patch_database_sectors_v2.py` — sector metadata patching
- `scripts/sync_docs_check.py` — warns when docs are out of sync with code changes
- `scripts/validation/` — one-off diagnostic scripts (DFC standalone verification, missing quarters, trimestral checks); safe to run as read-only audits

Dead/archived scripts are in `archive/` at the repo root — do not touch those.

**Script convention**: prefer keeping user-tunable values near the top of executable scripts and avoid burying operational constants deep in the logic.

## Critical Conventions

**Numeric types**: Always `int(year)` before using as SQLite param — numpy `int64` causes silent failures.

**yfinance `dividendYield`**: Already in % form — do NOT multiply by 100.

**SQLAlchemy IN clauses**: Use `bindparam("x", expanding=True)` for list parameters.

**B3 API**: `issuingCompany` = 4-letter base code (e.g., `"PETR"`); `codeCVM` = `cd_cvm` from DB.

**`_upsert_company_metadata`**: Uses INSERT OR IGNORE + UPDATE (not REPLACE) to preserve existing CNPJ/ticker data.

**Account normalization**: `normalize_account_name()` → lowercase, remove accents, collapse spaces. `generate_line_id_base()` creates stable IDs from `CD_CONTA` or `DS_CONTA_norm`.

**Streamlit JS injection**: Use `st.components.v1.html()` to embed `<script>` tags — `st.markdown` does not execute JavaScript.

**pandas `pivot_table` and NaN index**: `pd.pivot_table()` silently drops rows where any index column is NaN. Always `fillna("")` on index columns before pivoting. This caused DFC sub-accounts (82% of rows) to disappear when `STANDARD_NAME` was NULL.

**Excel number formats**: Zeros display as `"-"`, negatives as `(1,234)` in red. Format string: `'#,##0;(#,##0);"-"'`. Applied to `subtotal_neg` and `neg_center` styles in `excel_exporter.py`.

**KPI UNIDADE column**: Every KPI row includes `UNIDADE` (`"%"` for percentages, `"x"` for ratios). Propagated through kpi_engine → excel_exporter → dashboard meta_cols.

## Deployment

**Environment variable**: `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...` (used by scraper, query layer, and dashboard).

**Task Scheduler**: `CVM_Atualizar_Dados` task runs `scripts/atualizar_dados.ps1` every Sunday at 07:00.

## Testing Conventions

- Tests use `unittest.mock.patch` — no real CVM API calls or DB writes
- Fixtures provide mocked `CVMScraper`, `CVMDatabase`, `AccountStandardizer`
- `conftest.py` at repo root inserts the project root into `sys.path` (required for `cvm_pyqt_app` imports)
- Test files: `test_scraper.py`, `test_cvm_pyqt_app.py`, `test_base_health_snapshot.py`, `test_database_portability.py`, `test_excel_exporter.py`, `test_statement_summary.py`, `test_utils.py`

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: record the lesson in the relevant issue comment, ADR, or durable doc
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review recent issues and docs before repeating work

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, chvious fixes — don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Issue Management

1. **Issue First**: no executable work starts without a `task issue`
2. **Worktree From Issue**: use `.claude/worktrees/<lane>/<issue-number>-<slug>/`
3. **Branch From Issue**: use `task/<issue-number>-<slug>`
4. **Track Progress in Issue**: keep status, checklist, and evidence current
5. **Close via PR**: use `Closes #<issue-number>` in the PR body
6. **Keep Docs Durable**: ADRs and durable docs stay in `docs/`; operational state stays in GitHub Issues

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
